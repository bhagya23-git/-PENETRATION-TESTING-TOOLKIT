## Internship Task-3: Penetration Testing Toolkit– Description
I had the opportunity to work on a hands-on cybersecurity project where I designed and implemented a Penetration Testing toolkit with multiple modules (e.g., port scanner, brute-forcer). The goal was to create an interactive, user-friendly GUI based ethical hacking tool that performs essential cybersecurity tasks commonly used in penetration testing, information gathering, and brute-force attacks in a legal and ethical environment.
This project was developed using Python for the core functionalities and Tkinter for building the graphical interface. The GUI provides a clean, interactive layout with colourful buttons and prompts to ensure ease of use, especially for beginners or those unfamiliar with command-line tools.
Key Functionalities & Modules:
1. Port Scanner
This module allows users to scan a target IP address or domain to detect open ports and the corresponding services. It utilizes Python’s socket library to perform a TCP port scan, identifying potential network vulnerabilities where services might be exposed unintentionally. The results are displayed in real-time through the GUI, highlighting which ports are open and which are closed.

2. IP Geolocation Finder
The geolocation tool helps users trace an IP address and retrieve information like:
•	Country
•	Region
•	City
•	Time zone
•	ISP
This feature uses web-based APIs to fetch accurate and up-to-date geolocation data and presents it clearly in the GUI. It can be used for threat analysis, identifying potential attackers’ locations, or testing IP masking techniques.

3. ZIP File Password Brute-Force Tool
This module simulates a dictionary-based brute-force attack to recover lost passwords from encrypted .zip files. The user uploads a protected ZIP file and a custom wordlist, and the tool attempts each password in the list until the correct one is found. The GUI displays each password attempt and clearly shows the result once the correct password is identified. This showcases the importance of using strong, unpredictable passwords.
GUI Features:
•	Intuitive Layout: Built using Tkinter, all tools are organized into well-labeled buttons.
•	Colourful Interface: Buttons and outputs are styled with vivid colors to enhance visual appeal.
•	Interactive Elements: File pickers, pop-up dialogs, and scrollable results improve usability.
•	No Command Line Required: Unlike many cybersecurity tools, this toolkit works fully through GUI – ideal for users from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
Skills Gained:
Through this project, I gained real-world experience in:
•	Network scanning and TCP protocol basics
•	IP tracing and data retrieval from web APIs
•	Ethical hacking principles like brute-force simulations
•	Building functional GUIs using Python’s Tkinter
•	Writing modular Python code using best practices

Outcome:
This project taught me how ethical hackers and penetration testers approach vulnerability discovery in a legal, safe, and systematic way. It also highlighted how cybersecurity tools can be made more accessible and user-friendly through visual interfaces.
